/**
 * 1) while for a Callable, the call() method needs to be implemented which returns a result on completion.
 * 2) Note that a thread canâ€™t be created with a Callable, it can only be created with a Runnable.
 * 3) Another difference is that the call() method can throw an exception whereas run() cannot.
 * 4) Call() method inside callable returns output which can be stored in **future** object
 * 5) Callable is similar to Runnable, in that it encapsulates a task that is meant to run on another thread,
 *    whereas a Future is used to store a result obtained from a different thread.
 *
 * 6) To create the thread, a Runnable is required. To obtain the result, a Future is required.
 *
 * 7) The Java library has the concrete type FutureTask, which implements Runnable and Future,
 * combining both functionality conveniently.
